Made by Michael Yohannes.
Two personal web projects:
One is a retirement search site, where users are recommended places to retire at based on user income-related information, and various societal metrics regarding the places. 
The other is an interactive Civil War site, with a map visualization detailing important battles, as well as visualizations detailing information about the conflict and the political circumstances surrounding it.
Email me at redsealabs@gmail.com if there's any questions about the website.
